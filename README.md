Polish dicts for password cracking

###### Haszysz? Nie, nie haszÄ™.

List of Polish names, nouns, adjectives, and possibly more to come in the future. Words are divided into separate files so your usual list of every word ever is one `cat` away, while more sophisticated attacks are easy (regexes done already for you) and efficient: for example using hashcat you may want to try adjective + noun combo like in `magicznyrolnik666`, but omit grammatically incorrect combos like `magicznarolnik`.
